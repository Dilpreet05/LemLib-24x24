# AYO VEXU

### Description

This program is the code for the AYO 15x15 robot in the 2024-2025 season of high stakes. The main branch is the branch that functions the best, any other branch is likely testing new features without ruining what we already have.

### Software

Currently we use Pros and LemLib to program our robot. We considered using VOSS but decided against it because LemLib fits our use cases more (especially the odometry tool).
